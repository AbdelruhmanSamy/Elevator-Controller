Unfortunatlly, testbench is not working :(
So, you can test it using a do file "tb_integrated_model.do"

Notes:
- we take a slow clock as input, because our "clock" module is not working :(

How to test our elevator:
- Set the runtime in modelsim to 3 ns
- Run the do file
- Set the runtime to 100 ns
- run simulation
- check output

test case is
floor 3 request
floor 1 request -> when moving from floor 1 to 2
floor 7 request -> before reaching floor 3

output is
move from floor 0 to 3, open door, go to floor 7, open the door, go down to floor 1, open door, then stay idle
